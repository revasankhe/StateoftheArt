In this project, we aim to answer the following question: “How well can AI recognize the emotion of a painted portrait?” Through neural networks and deep learning, we will explore how (or if) machine learning can classify emotions of painted portraits. For example, how would you describe the emotion of the Mona Lisa? Sad? Happy? Neutral?
